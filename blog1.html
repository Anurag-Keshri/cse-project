                  <p align="center" class="ronald">Election in University</p>
                  <p class="alicia">A student learns a lot other than academics in his/her college life rather that is the best time to add to one's life experience. For a student , extra curriculum activities in University play a major role in
                    his/her overall growth and that is the best time to enrich their minds with the knowledge of what is happening around the world . But there is more to add to curriculum activities when we talk about making students aware of
                    politics , and what other than the idea of involving elections in University may strike your head? </p>
                  <p class="alicia">Elections in University is a topic of double edged sword , holding downsides and upsides , it has become one of the most debatable topics and is hitting the list hard. </p>
                  <p class="alicia">It is argued that holding elections is an evil done by politics to the education that places pressure on the young minds and is a source to invoke conflicts. Take the example of JNU and DU that has lost the
                    environment for education. If election is just another pile adding to the heap of blunders for students pursuing education in university then why to have them at all?</p>
                  <p class="alicia">One of the major reason can be that students are the next generation to be changing the world , they are the ones we are handing over the future of the nation to and so they must be fully aware of how the world
                    works and how the politics can bring about great changes in society and help young minds boost their career in fields of politics . So eventually our concern is about preparing them to deal with politics.</p>
                  <p class="alicia">When elections are held in University a big mount of funds are discharged spoiling the genuine environment. It has also been noted that politicians subject to flout rules of fair campaigning and bringing about
                    violent acts and riots placing students in the surrounding of conflicts and affecting their education in slightly an ugly way. Such violent acts leave students in a condition involving in fights rather than heading over to
                    learning about politics.
                  </p>
                  <p class="alicia">One may point out that in order to get rid of such acts we can ban elections and make students learn about politics theoretically or placing heavy restrictions over holding elections. One way can be selecting
                    representatives without casting of vote but the selection must be done by heads or judges as an alternative to the conduction of elections. The idea sounds interesting and hassle free but there is a flaw in its practical use.</p>
                  <p class=alicia>Firstly , what makes India a democratic country?
                    In India , The Election Commission follows a certain system to conduct elections , it is followed in such a way that every citizen of India gets the right to select their representatives and that’s what Democracy is all about ,
                    empowering every citizen without the discrimination of caste , age , race , religion etc. By letting only a handful of people decide for the next president in the University may violet the system that our nation had been following
                    all this long and more importantly it is not only about the system to follow but it takes away the rights of many individuals to give their opinion and leaving them empty handed and powerless. </p>
                  <p class="alicia">Moreover , snatching away from students their role in participating in elections held in University may leave them to no knowledge of how it goes round . It is well said that a person learns more from his
                    experiences than just a thorough reading . Only a surface knowledge may never be a good start for a person wishing to master politics , it requires experience and participation to understand better.</p>
                  <p class="alicia">I would rather have an experienced elective with less theoretical idea than to have an elective who is less experienced but full of theoretical concepts.</p>
                  <p class="alicia">Political parties nurse students and lure them into a social awkwardness. There is a need to keep check on the misuse of power that politicians make to turn the tables in their profit . But banning things out can
                    never be a good solution to any problem , so instead of banning elections out there is a need to take measures to conduct fair elections without any violence .</p>
