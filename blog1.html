            A student learns a lot other than academics in his/her college life
            rather that is the best time to add to one's life experience. For a
            student , extra curriculum activities in University play a major
            role in his/her overall growth and that is the best time to enrich
            their minds with the knowledge of what is happening around the world
            . But there is more to add to curriculum activities when we talk
            about making students aware of politics , and what other than the
            idea of involving elections in University may strike your head?
          </p>
          <p class="">
            Elections in University is a topic of double edged sword , holding
            downsides and upsides , it has become one of the most debatable
            topics and is hitting the list hard.
          </p>
          <p class="">
            It is argued that holding elections is an evil done by politics to
            the education that places pressure on the young minds and is a
            source to invoke conflicts. Take the example of JNU and DU that has
            lost the environment for education. If election is just another pile
            adding to the heap of blunders for students pursuing education in
            university then why to have them at all?
          </p>
          <p class="">
            One of the major reason can be that students are the next generation
            to be changing the world , they are the ones we are handing over the
            future of the nation to and so they must be fully aware of how the
            world works and how the politics can bring about great changes in
            society and help young minds boost their career in fields of
            politics . So eventually our concern is about preparing them to deal
            with politics.
          </p>
          <p class="">
            When elections are held in University a big mount of funds are
            discharged spoiling the genuine environment. It has also been noted
            that politicians subject to flout rules of fair campaigning and
            bringing about violent acts and riots placing students in the
            surrounding of conflicts and affecting their education in slightly
            an ugly way. Such violent acts leave students in a condition
            involving in fights rather than heading over to learning about
            politics.
          </p>
          <p class="">
            One may point out that in order to get rid of such acts we can ban
            elections and make students learn about politics theoretically or
            placing heavy restrictions over holding elections. One way can be
            selecting representatives without casting of vote but the selection
            must be done by heads or judges as an alternative to the conduction
            of elections. The idea sounds interesting and hassle free but there
            is a flaw in its practical use.
          </p>
          <p class="">
            Firstly , what makes India a democratic country? In India , The
            Election Commission follows a certain system to conduct elections ,
            it is followed in such a way that every citizen of India gets the
            right to select their representatives and that’s what Democracy is
            all about , empowering every citizen without the discrimination of
            caste , age , race , religion etc. By letting only a handful of
            people decide for the next president in the University may violet
            the system that our nation had been following all this long and more
            importantly it is not only about the system to follow but it takes
            away the rights of many individuals to give their opinion and
            leaving them empty handed and powerless.
          </p>
          <p class="">
            Moreover , snatching away from students their role in participating
            in elections held in University may leave them to no knowledge of
            how it goes round . It is well said that a person learns more from
            his experiences than just a thorough reading . Only a surface
            knowledge may never be a good start for a person wishing to master
            politics , it requires experience and participation to understand
            better.
          </p>
          <p class="">
            I would rather have an experienced elective with less theoretical
            idea than to have an elective who is less experienced but full of
            theoretical concepts.
          </p>
          <p class="">
            Political parties nurse students and lure them into a social
            awkwardness. There is a need to keep check on the misuse of power
            that politicians make to turn the tables in their profit . But
            banning things out can never be a good solution to any problem , so
            instead of banning elections out there is a need to take measures to
            conduct fair elections without any violence .
